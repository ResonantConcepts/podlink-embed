## Features
* Replaces all links to [pod.link](https://pod.link) with on-page modals
* Allows visitors to save their preferred app in a cookie and skip the modal
* Passes URL parameters, allowing sites to participate in the [Apple Partner Program](https://performance-partners.apple.com/)

## Installation
Include the following script on all pages of your site with links to [pod.link](https://pod.link)
```
<script src="https://podlink-embed.netlify.app/embed.bundle.js"></script>
```

## Methods
### exclude
If you would like to remove some badges from appearing in the modal for a link, list them within a `data-exclude` attribute seperated by commas. If the userâ€™s preferred app (as set in a browser cookie) is excluded, then those visitors will be forced to select a different destination.
```
<a href="https://pod.link/vergecast" data-exclude="apple,spotify,google,overcast,podcastaddict,pocketcasts,castbox,stitcher,iheartradio,playerfm,castro,radiopublic,rss">Listen Now</a>
```

### override
If you would like to include a badge but podlink is redirecting to the wrong URL for a platform, you can use the `data-override` attribute to provide some JSON and override the default destination.
```
<a href="https://pod.link/vergecast" data-override='{
  "overcast":"overcast://x-callback-url/add?url=https://feeds.megaphone.fm/vergecast",
  "radiopublic":"https://radiopublic.com/Vergecast"
}'>Listen Now</a>
```

### trigger
If you would like to open the modal for a link upon page load, you can add a `data-trigger` attribute to immediately simulate a click. If there are multiple podlinks with this attribute, it will only fire for the first one.

```
<a href="https://pod.link/vergecast" data-trigger>Listen Now</a>
```
